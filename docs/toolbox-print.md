Features for allowing you to print to the console.

You can access these tools on the Gluegun toolbox, via `const { print } = require('gluegun')`, or directly via `const { print } = require('gluegun/print')`.

## info

Prints an informational message. Use this as your goto.

```js
toolbox.print.info('Hello.  I am a chatty plugin.')
```

## success

Print a "something good just happened" message.

```js
toolbox.print.success('We did it!')
```

## warning

Prints a warning message. Use this when you feel a disturbance in the force.

```js
toolbox.print.warning("Your system does not have Yarn installed.  It's awesome.")
```

## error

Prints an error message. Use this when something goes Pants-On-Head wrong. What does that mean?
Well, if your next line of code isn't `process.exit(0)`, then it was probably a warning.

```js
toolbox.print.error('Out of disk space.  lol.')
```

## debug

Only used for debugging your plugins. You can pass this function a string or an object.

```js
toolbox.print.debug(someObject, 'download status')
```

The `message` parameter is object you would like to see.

The `title` is an optional title message which is handy if you've got a lot of debug messages and
you're losing track of which one is which.

## colors

An object for working with printing colors on the command line. It is from the `colors` NPM package,
however we define a theme to make things a bit consistent.

Some available functions include:

| function           | use when you want...                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `colors.success()` | the user to smile                        |
| `colors.error()`   | to say something has failed              |
| `colors.warn()`    | to point out that something might be off |
| `colors.info()`    | to say something informational           |
| `colors.muted()`   | you need to say something secondary      |

Each take a `string` parameter and return a `string`.

One gotcha here is that the length of the string is longer than you think because of the embedded
color codes that disappear when you print them. ðŸ”¥

## spin

Creates a spinner for long running tasks on the command line. It's
[ora](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ora)!

Here's an example of how to work with it:

```js
// a spinner starts with the text you provide
const spinner = toolbox.print.spin('Time for fun!')
await toolbox.system.run('sleep 5')
```

ðŸš¨ Important ðŸš¨ - Make sure you don't print anything else while a spinner is going. You need to stop
it first.

There's a few ways to stop it.

```js
// stop it & clear the text
spinner.stop()

// stop it, leave a checkmark, and optional new text
spinner.succeed('woot!')

// stop it, leave an X, and optional new text
spinner.fail('womp womp.')

// stop it, leave a custom label, and optional new text
spinner.stopAndPersist({ symbol: 'ðŸš¨', text: 'osnap!' })
```

Once stopped, you can start it again later.

```js
spinner.start()
```

You can change the color of the spinner by setting:

```js
spinner.color = 'cyan'
```

The text can also be set with the normal printing colors.

```js
spinner.text = toolbox.print.colors.green('i like trees')
```

## printHelp

Prints a default help screen, consisting of the brand name, version, and `printCommands` output (next).

```js
const { printHelp } = toolbox.print
printHelp(toolbox)
```

## printCommands

Prints out a table of available commands in a given toolbox.

```js
const { printCommands } = toolbox.print
printCommands(toolbox)
```

You can pass in a "command path" to refine what commands you'd like to see:

```js
const { printCommands } = toolbox.print
printCommands(toolbox, ['generate', 'model'])
```

## table

Prints out a table of data, including a header. You can choose from three different formats:
`default`, `markdown`, and `lean`.

```js
const { table } = toolbox.print
table(
  [
    ['First Name', 'Last Name', 'Age'],
    ['Jamon', 'Holmgren', 35],
    ['Gant', 'Laborde', 36],
    ['Steve', 'Kellock', 43],
    ['Gary', 'Busey', 73],
  ],
  { format: 'markdown' },
)
```

Output:

```
| First Name | Last Name | Age |
| ---------- | --------- | --- |
| Jamon      | Holmgren  | 35  |
| Gant       | Laborde   | 36  |
| Steve      | Kellock   | 43  |
| Gary       | Busey     | 73  |
```
