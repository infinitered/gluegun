With the gluegun API, you're able to load & execute commands.

Check out the [sniff](./sniff.md) module for detecting if your environment is able to run.


Here's what we're about to cover.

```js
const { build } = 'gluegun'

await build()
  .brand('movie')
  .configFile('./movie.toml')
  .loadDefault(`${__dirname}/core-plugins`)
  .load('~/Desktop/movie/quote')
  .load('~/Desktop/movie/credits')
  .loadAll('~/Downloads/VariousMoviePlugins')
  .loadAll('./node_modules', { matching: 'movies-*', hidden: true })
  .token('commandName', 'cliCommand')
  .token('commandDescription', 'cliDescription')
  .token('extensionName', 'contextExtension')
  .on('start', () => {
    console.log('Welcome to movie CLI!')
  })
  .createRuntime()
  .run()
```


## build

Grab the `build` function from `gluegun`.

```js
const { build } = require('gluegun')
```

Now let's build a `gluegun` runtime environment by configuring various features.

```js
const runtime = build()
```

But out of the box, it does very little.  And by very little I mean nothing.  So let's configure this.

We'll be chaining the `build()` function from here.


## brand

**Brand** is used through-out the glue for things like configuration file names and folder names for plugins.

```js
  .brand('movie')
```

The brand is most likely to share the same name of the CLI.



## createRuntime

At this point, we've been configuring our environment.  When we're ready, we call:

```js
  .createRuntime()
```

This command applies the configuration that you were just chaining, and turns it into a `Runtime` which supports calling `run()`.

```js
  const runtime = build()
    .brand('movie')
    .load('~/Desktop/movie/quote')
    .load('~/Desktop/movie/credits')
    .loadAll('~/Downloads/VariousMoviePlugins')
    .createRuntime()
```

And now we're ready to run:

```js
  runtime.run()
```

With no parameters, `gluegun` will parse the command line arguments looking for the commmand to run.

```sh
# list the plugins
$ movie

# list the commands of a plugin
$ movie quote

# run a command
$ movie quote random

# run a command with options
$ movie quote random --funny

# run a command with arguments
$ movie credits actors Kingpin

# run a command with arguments & options
$ movie credits producers "Planes, Trains, & Automobiles" --sort age
```

So you see, it takes at least 2 extra arguments to run a command. That's because you can have multiple plugins and we need to qualify your commands with a namespace.

Which sucks, if it weren't for:



## load

Functionality is added to the `gluegun` object with [plugins](./plugins.md). Plugins can be yours or your users.

You can load a plugin from a directory:

```js
  .load('~/Desktop/movie/quote')
  .load('~/Desktop/movie/credits')
```

## loadAll

You can also load all immediate sub-directories located within it a directory.

```js
  .loadAll('~/Downloads/VariousMoviePlugins')
```

Load all supports a `fs-jetpack` [matching pattern](https://github.com/szwacz/fs-jetpack#findpath-searchoptions) so you can filter out a subset of directories instead of just all.

```js
  .loadAll('node_modules', { matching: 'movies-*' })
```

If you would like to keep plugins hidden and not available at the command line:

```js
  .loadAll('node_modules', { matching: 'movies-*', hidden: true })
```

When plugins are hidden they can still be run directly from the runtime.


## loadDefault

One of your plugins can be a special snowflake.

```js
  .loadDefault('~/Desktop/movie/credits')
```

Normally the command line order goes:

1. `program`
2. `plugin`
3. `command`

With the default plugin, however, we drop the `plugin` and it becomes:

1. `program`
2. `command`

So, from our previous section, had we promoted the credits plugin to default, we could access it's actions like this:

```sh
# run a command with arguments
$ movie actors Kingpin

# run a command with arguments & options
$ movie producers "Planes, Trains, & Automobiles" --sort age
```

Commands from the default plugin will now be evaluated first. If there is a match, they will be chosen over any other plugins.


For simpler CLIs, you might find this is a much easier way to build. You might not need the flexibility of multiple plugins and can get away with 1 plugin which is installed as the default.

## run

`gluegun` can also be `run()` with options.

```js
await runtime.run({
  pluginName: 'quote',
  rawCommand: 'random "*johnny"',
  options: {
    funny: true,
    genre: 'Horror',
    weapon: 'axe'
  }
})
```

There's a few situations that make this useful.

1. Maybe you like to use `meow` or `commander` to parse the command line.
2. Maybe your interface isn't a CLI.
3. Maybe you want to run several command in a row.
4. Maybe this is your program and you don't like strangers telling you how to code.

Bottom line, is you get to pick. It's yours. `gluegun` is just glue.


## token

Command and extension can have some meta data embedded in a JavaScript comment. This is how you're able to set the:

* command name
* command description
* extension name

You can configure this setting

```js
  .token('commandName', 'omgCommand')
  .token('commandDescription', 'lolDescription')
  .token('extensionName', 'sweet!!!')
```

The token you choose will still be prefixed by a `@` when it searches in the file.  It also needs to remain located within a JavaScript comment.


## configFile

Each plugin can have its own configuration file where it places defaults.  These defaults can then be overridden by reading defaults from a configuration file.

You can specify your config file to read from the current directory like this:

```js
  .configFile('./movie.toml')
```

A configuration file is a [TOML](./what-is-toml.md) file.

It will read the plugin name from the `name` key and the defaults will be read from the `[defaults]` section.  Each section underneath `default` can be used to override the sections of the plugin.  Since that was horribly explained, here's an example.

```toml
[defaults.movie]
cache = '~/.movies/cache'

[defaults.another]
count = 100
```
