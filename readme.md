# Gluegun

![gluegun](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1479215/50237287-5a23e380-0371-11e9-89ea-85b41cd25217.jpg)

Gluegun is a delightful toolkit for building Node-based command-line interfaces (CLIs) in TypeScript or modern JavaScript, with support for:

üåØ *parameters* - command-line arguments and options<br />
üéõ *template* - generating files from templates<br />
üóÑ *patching* - manipulating file contents<br />
üíæ *filesystem* - moving files and directories around<br />
‚öí *system* - executing other command-line scripts<br />
üéÖ *http* - interacting with API servers<br />
üõé *prompt* - auto-complete prompts<br />
üíÉ *print* - printing pretty colors and tables<br />
üë©‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è *semver* - working with semantic versioning<br />
üéª *strings* - manipulating strings & template data<br />

In addition, `gluegun` supports expanding your CLI's ecosystem with a robust set of easy-to-write plugins and extensions.

# Why use Gluegun?

You might want to use Gluegun if:

* You need to build a CLI app
* You want to have powerful tools at your fingertips
* And you don't want to give up flexibility at the same time

If so ... welcome!

# Quick Start

Just run the `gluegun` CLI like this:

```
# spin up your new CLI
npx gluegun new movies

# choose TypeScript or Modern JavaScript
# now jump into the source
cd movies

# and link your new executable
yarn link

# and run it!
movies help
```

You should see your new CLI help. Open the folder in your favorite editor and start building your CLI!

# Code

Let's start with what a `gluegun` CLI looks like.

```js
// in movie/src/cli.[js|ts]...

// ready
const { build } = require('gluegun')

// aim
const movieCLI = build('movie')
  .src(`${__dirname}/core-plugins`)
  .plugins('node_modules', { matching: 'movie-*' })
  .help()
  .version()
  .defaultCommand()
  .create()

// fire!
movieCLI.run()
```

**Commands**

Commands are simple objects that provide a name, optional aliases, and a function to run.

```js
// in movie/src/commands/foo.js
module.exports = {
  name: 'foo',
  alias: 'f',
  run: async function(toolbox) {
    // gluegun provides all these features and more!
    const { system, print, filesystem, strings } = toolbox

    // ...and be the CLI you wish to see in the world
    const awesome = strings.trim(await system.run('whoami'))
    const moreAwesome = strings.kebabCase(`${awesome} and a keyboard`)
    const contents = `üö® Warning! ${moreAwesome} coming thru! üö®`
    const home = process.env['HOME']
    filesystem.write(`${home}/realtalk.json`, { contents })

    print.info(`${print.checkmark} Citius`)
    print.warning(`${print.checkmark} Altius`)
    print.success(`${print.checkmark} Fortius`)
  }
}
```

See the [toolbox api docs](./docs/toolbox-api.md) for more details on what you can do.

See the [runtime docs](./docs/runtime.md) for more details on building your own CLI and join us in the #gluegun channel of the Infinite Red Community Slack ([community.infinite.red](http://community.infinite.red)) to get friendly help!
